Webgati AI is a Chrome & MS Edge browser extension for chatting with any webpage. Whether you're researching, studying, or just exploring diverse content, Webgati AI is designed to efficiently guide you through webpages by providing quick summaries and answers directly from the content.

### Features

- Interactive Sidebar: Open a chat by clicking the extension icon, ask questions or seek summaries from any webpage effortlessly.

- Content Selection Dialog: Highlight text, and a dialog box will pop up to allow direct interaction with the content.

- Vision chat: Easily ask questions about the visual information on the page (images, graphs, etc.) by using the extension to take a screenshot or select an area of the page.

- Privacy-Focused: 
    - Use private local models via [Ollama](#ollama-setup) for complete privacy
    - OR use your own API key to access cloud-based model providers, your chat is directly sent to their API, not to any other server, thus ensuring your data remains private and secure. (Currently OpenAI and Anthropic are supported, more model providers will be available soon, reach out for any specific model request)

- Open Source: Community-driven and transparent, allowing for continuous improvement and collective auditing.
